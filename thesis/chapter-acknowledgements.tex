\huge Acknowledgments

\end{center}

First I would like to thank Jun.-Prof. Dr.-Ing. Kalman Graffi and my supervisor Andreas Disterhöft for their professional and comprehensive support. Without them, this thesis would not be in its present form. I am particularly grateful for Andreas Disterhöft's assistance during the evaluation.

Furthermore, I would like to express my gratitude to my parents, who always supported me and made all of this possible, and my sister, who helped me in difficult situations to stay focused.

I also thank Matthias Hesse, who helped me out in several cases by taking off obligations of mine, which would have prevented me to work on the thesis.
